How to Use the Tiny Paint App Inside Reveal.js
==================================================

Option A — Use the provided paintslide.html as a ready‑to‑present deck
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Put `paintslide.html` anywhere in your project (or open it directly in a browser).
2) It already includes Reveal.js from a CDN and embeds the Tiny Paint App on its own slide.
3) Present with arrow keys or space; draw on the “Tiny Paint App” slide.

Option B — Embed the app into your existing Reveal.js deck
----------------------------------------------------------
You have two choices: inline (recommended for simplicity) or via iframe (isolated sandbox).

B1) Inline (copy sections and script)
-------------------------------------
1) In your deck’s HTML, add a slide where the app will live:

   <section>
     <div class="app" id="paint-deck-app">
       <!-- toolbar + canvas + footer go here -->
     </div>
   </section>

2) Copy the CSS rules that scope to `.app` into your page’s <style> block (or a CSS file).
3) Copy the Tiny Paint App JS into a <script> tag near the end of the body, after Reveal is loaded.
4) Make sure Reveal is initialized (e.g., `Reveal.initialize({ hash:true })`).
5) Open the deck in a browser; navigate to the paint slide and draw.

B2) Iframe (keeps styles isolated)
----------------------------------
1) Save the standalone app as `tiny-paint.html`.
2) In your slide, embed it like:

   <section>
     <iframe src="tiny-paint.html" style="width:100%;height:80vh;border:0;border-radius:12px"></iframe>
   </section>

3) Present as usual; the paint app stays contained in the iframe.

CDN vs Local Reveal.js
----------------------
• The sample uses Reveal.js via CDN for convenience.
• If your project already ships Reveal locally, remove the CDN <link>/<script> tags and use your local `dist/` and `plugin/` files.

Keyboard Shortcuts (during a talk)
----------------------------------
• E — eraser toggle
• Ctrl/⌘ + Z — undo
• Ctrl/⌘ + S — download PNG
• Hold Shift — straight lines
• [ / ] — brush size down/up

Tips for Presenting
-------------------
• Add a “reset/clear” moment between topics: hit “Clear” so the audience sees the next sketch build from zero.
• Keep brush size visible; it’s echoed as “14px” etc next to the slider.
• Practice the first stroke on each slide to create an undo snapshot early.

Common Pitfalls
---------------
• If your deck uses aggressive CSS resets, keep the app styles scoped under `.app` to avoid conflicts.
• Canvas too short? Ensure the slide container has enough height; the app computes size from layout.
• Mobile devices may have toolbars that reduce viewport size; rotate to landscape for more drawing space.

Deployment
----------
• Works as a static HTML file—host it on Netlify/GitHub Pages or open from disk.
• No backend required.

File Map (suggested)
--------------------
/your-deck/
  index.html            ← your Reveal.js deck
  tiny-paint.html       ← optional standalone app (for iframe mode)
  css/app.css           ← if you extract .app styles
  js/paint-app.js       ← if you extract the inline <script>

That’s it—drag, draw, erase, undo, and save!
