Explaining Dynamic Media Filters (CDN Version)

What it is
A demo slide that lets you adjust blur, grayscale, hue rotation, brightness, and contrast on an image.

Why this file is standalone
It loads Reveal.js from CDN, so it works no matter where it’s saved.

How the code works (short breakdown)
• HTML: An <img> with id="filterTarget" and five range sliders.
• CSS: Styles the image and slider layout.
• JS:
  - Reads slider values via getElementById().value.
  - Applies a CSS filter string (e.g., blur(2px) grayscale(0.5)).
  - Updates image instantly on input events.

One-sentence explanation to say out loud
“This filter demo uses sliders to change an image’s CSS filters live, and it works from any folder thanks to CDN links.”
