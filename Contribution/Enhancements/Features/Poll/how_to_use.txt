Reveal.js Live Poll Feature — How to Use (Step-by-Step)

Host link (console): https://newpoll.netlify.app/
Voter link pattern:   https://newpoll.netlify.app/voter/?poll=<pollId>

A) Presenting a Poll (Host)
1) Open the host page on any computer: https://newpoll.netlify.app/
2) In “Admin Secret”, paste your ADMIN_SIGNING_SECRET (it’s stored locally after first use).
3) In “Poll ID”, type a short identifier (e.g., test123).
4) Type your question and put each option on its own line.
5) Set “Max selections”:
   - 1 = single choice
   - >1 = audience can pick up to that many options
6) Click “Publish (Open)”.
   - A QR code appears with the voter link for this pollId.
   - The “Active version” and “State” are shown on the right.
7) Ask the audience to scan the QR code or visit the voter link. The chart updates live.

B) Voting (Audience)
1) Open the QR link (e.g., https://newpoll.netlify.app/voter/?poll=test123).
2) Read the question and pick your option(s).
3) Press “Submit vote”. You’ll see a confirmation.
   Notes:
   - If you vote again from the same device, your previous vote is replaced (no duplicates).

C) Locking and Resetting (Host)
- Lock: stops new votes for the active version.
- Reset: clears current counts and device votes for the active version (useful for rerunning the same question).

D) Tips During a Lecture
- Publish the poll while introducing the question so the QR code is already on screen.
- Keep Poll ID simple and readable in case anyone types the URL manually.
- After discussion, press Lock and briefly recap the results.
- For a new question, change the text/options and press Publish again (creates a new version automatically).

E) If Something Doesn’t Work
- Buttons do nothing → Enter the Admin Secret on the host page first.
- QR not showing → Ensure the QRCode script is loaded (already bundled in the host page).
- Votes not changing → Check internet connectivity; if the poll is “locked”, unlock or publish a new version.
- Error about firebaseConfig → Make sure the page initializes Firebase once (avoid duplicate declarations).

That’s it — publish, share the QR, watch the chart, lock/reset when done.
