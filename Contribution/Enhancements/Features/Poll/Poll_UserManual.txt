Poll Feature — User Manual (CDN Version)

Feature
An interactive poll where the audience can click buttons to vote. Votes are displayed live in a bar chart.

How to Use
1) Open this HTML file in any browser. It works anywhere because it uses CDN links for Reveal.js.
2) On the Poll slide, click one of the buttons (React, Vue, or Svelte).
3) Each click adds a vote and updates the chart instantly.
4) Refresh the page to reset all votes.

Advantages
• Engages the audience with interactive participation.
• No backend or server required; runs entirely in the browser.
• CDN links ensure it works from any folder with no broken paths.
