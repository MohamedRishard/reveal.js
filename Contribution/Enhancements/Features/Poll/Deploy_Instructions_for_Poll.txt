How to Deploy Poll.html with GitHub Pages

Hello,

Here are the steps to make the Poll.html file available as a working link on GitHub Pages for the reveal.js fork.

1. Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled on the repository
   - Go to: Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: master (or the branch you want to serve)
   - Folder: / (root)
   - Save. You should see a green banner with a live URL like:
     https://<username>.github.io/reveal.js/

2. Add Poll.html to the branch that Pages is serving
   - If you want a shorter link:
     Place Poll.html directly in the root of the repo, commit and push.
     Then the live URL will be:
     https://<username>.github.io/reveal.js/Poll.html
   - If you keep it in a nested folder (Contribution/Enhancements/Features/Poll/):
     The live URL will be longer:
     	Thin link >> https://mohamedrishard.github.io/reveal.js/Contribution/Enhancements/Features/Poll/Poll.html

3. After committing and pushing Poll.html to the correct branch, wait 1–2 minutes for Pages to redeploy.

4. Share the links
   - Host view (for lecturer/presenter):
     >>  https://mohamedrishard.github.io/reveal.js/Contribution/Enhancements/Features/Poll/Poll.html?mode=host&poll=demo-abc
   - Voter view (for audience):
     >> https://mohamedrishard.github.io/reveal.js/Contribution/Enhancements/Features/Poll/Poll.html?mode=voter&poll=demo-abc

Important:
- GitHub Pages is case-sensitive. Folder names in the URL must exactly match the repo.
- If you want a fresh poll (cleared votes), change the poll ID (e.g. poll=demo-xyz).
- Ensure Poll.html includes the Supabase config (url + anon key) for realtime voting.

Thank you!
