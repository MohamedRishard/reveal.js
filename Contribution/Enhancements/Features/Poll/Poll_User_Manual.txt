User Manual – Poll.html (Reveal.js Interactive Poll)
====================================================

1. What is Poll.html?
---------------------
Poll.html is a slide deck with a live poll embedded inside a Reveal.js presentation. 
It allows audience members to cast a vote for options A, B, C, or D, and immediately 
see the results displayed as a bar chart.

2. How to Run It
----------------
1. Save Poll.html on your computer.
2. Open the file in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).
3. Navigate through the slides. The poll slide includes four voting buttons and a chart.

3. Voting
---------
On the poll slide, you will see four buttons (A, B, C, D). 
Clicking one button increases that option’s count by one, and the bar chart updates.

4. Resetting the Poll
---------------------
The Reset button clears all votes back to zero and redraws the chart.

5. One-Vote Limitation
----------------------
The poll can be adapted to limit each browser/device to a single vote by using localStorage. 
Once a user votes, the buttons are disabled until Reset is pressed.

6. Why We Cannot Prevent Multi-Device Voting
--------------------------------------------
Since this poll runs only in the browser, it has no central server. 
That means each device (laptop, phone, tablet) keeps its own separate vote record. 
If someone opens the poll in a different device or in an incognito window, they can vote again. 
To enforce strict one-person-one-vote rules across many devices, a server-side system is required 
(e.g., with user accounts, session tokens, or IP checks).

7. Use Cases
------------
- Classroom quizzes
- Audience engagement in workshops
- Simple local surveys
- Demonstrations of interactive features in Reveal.js
