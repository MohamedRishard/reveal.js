Explaining Poll Feature (CDN Version)

What it is
A simple interactive poll that updates a bar chart when audience members click vote buttons.

Why this file is standalone
This demo uses CDN links for Reveal.js, so it works from any folder without needing local dist/ or plugin/ paths.

How the code works (short breakdown)
• HTML: Buttons for React/Vue/Svelte and a <canvas> element for the chart.
• CSS: Styles the buttons and chart display.
• JS:
  - Keeps track of votes in a counts object.
  - When a button is clicked, its count increases.
  - drawPoll() redraws the canvas bars to reflect new values.
  - resizePoll() ensures chart scales with window size.

One-sentence explanation to say out loud
“This poll demo uses buttons and a canvas to collect votes and redraw a chart, and it works anywhere because it loads Reveal.js from a CDN.”
