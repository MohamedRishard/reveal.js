Explaining Slide Overlays (CDN Version)

What it is
Overlays add decorative visual layers (dark gradient, grid lines, or dots) to slides.

Why this file is standalone
It loads Reveal.js from CDN, so the demo works from any folder with no local paths needed.

How the code works (short breakdown)
• HTML: Each <section> has data-overlay="dark", "grid", or "dots".
• CSS: Uses ::after pseudo-element to draw the overlay.
• Extra: corner-badge and bottom-ribbon elements provide labels/captions.
• JS: A keydown listener toggles overlays globally with 'O'.

One-sentence explanation to say out loud
“This overlay demo uses CSS and a data-overlay attribute to add visual styles to slides, and it runs anywhere thanks to CDN links.”
