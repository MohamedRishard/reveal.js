Slide Overlays — User Manual (CDN Version)

Feature
Adds decorative overlays per slide, such as dark shading, grid, or dotted patterns.

How to Use
1) Open this HTML file in a browser (works anywhere because of CDN links).
2) Each slide can specify data-overlay="dark", "grid", or "dots".
3) Optionally add <div class="corner-badge"> or <div class="bottom-ribbon"> for labels/captions.
4) Press 'O' to toggle overlays on or off during the presentation.

Advantages
• Visual variety and separation between slides.
• Lightweight CSS approach, no external libraries needed.
• CDN links ensure portability across folders.
