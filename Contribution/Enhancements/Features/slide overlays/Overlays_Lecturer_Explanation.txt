Explaining Overlays.html to Lecturer

Purpose

The project demonstrates how Reveal.js presentations can be enhanced
with overlays. These overlays are CSS-based visual effects that improve
text readability and design.

Key Features

1.  Three overlay styles: dark, grid, and dots.
2.  Customization using CSS variables per slide (opacity, size, color).
3.  On-screen toggle button and keyboard shortcut (O) to enable/disable
    overlays globally.
4.  Example slides show how each overlay looks.

Why It Matters

-   Enhances readability on busy or photo-based backgrounds.
-   Adds modern visual styling without extra plugins.
-   Simple to use: just add data-overlay to slides.

How to Show It

1.  Open Overlays.html in the browser.
2.  Navigate through the three example slides.
3.  Demonstrate pressing “O” or using the toggle button.
4.  Show how changing CSS variables affects overlays.

Talking Points

-   Emphasize how Reveal.js is web-based and customizable.
-   Stress that this is done entirely with HTML + CSS (no extra plugin).
-   Explain practical use: better presentations, more engaging for the
    audience.
