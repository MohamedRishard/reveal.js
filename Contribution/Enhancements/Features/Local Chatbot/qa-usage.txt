Local Q&A Chatbot for Reveal.js — Quick Usage Guide

What this is
A single-file helper (QA.html) that adds a draggable Q&A panel on top of a Reveal.js deck.
It runs fully local (no internet, no APIs) and answers only from the slide text and speaker notes.

Where to save it
C:\Users\iamda\OneDrive\Desktop\WebTechnologies\reveal.js\Contribution\Enhancements\Features\Local Chatbot\QA.html

How to open
1) Double-click QA.html (or open in Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
2) Press Q to toggle the Q&A panel.
3) Type a question and press Enter.

What gets indexed
• Slide text (headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks)
• Speaker notes (inside <aside class="notes"> or data-notes)
• Hidden slides are ignored unless you explicitly include them when you customize

Keyboard shortcuts
• Q — Toggle the panel
• R — Rebuild the index (with the panel open); Shift+R always rebuilds
• ESC — Close the panel
• Enter — Ask the question when the input is focused

Draggable controls
• Floating “💬 Q&A” button: drag anywhere; click to open/close the panel
• Q&A panel: drag by its header; resize from the bottom-right corner

Answer behavior
• Answers are grounded in the deck only; the panel shows “Grounded in:” citations
• Clicking a citation jumps to that slide and briefly highlights it
• If the bot cannot find a good match, it shows this message:
  “I couldn’t find a reliable answer in these slides. Try rephrasing your question or check if the topic is covered in the deck.”

Panel options
• Sources: Slides / Notes / Both (default: Both)
• Style: Concise / Detailed
• Quotes‑only: When ON, the bot stitches direct quotes from the slides instead of paraphrasing

Rebuild Index (↻)
Click ↻ or press R to re-scan the current deck after you add, remove, or edit slides.
A toast confirms the number of slides/notes/chunks indexed.

Copying answers
Use “Copy answer” or “Copy w/ citations” to put the response on your clipboard.

Testing questions (demo deck)
• “What is Auto‑Animate and how do I enable it?”
• “How do I change the theme?”
• “Show me the keyboard shortcuts.”
• “Who developed relativity?”
• “Which scientist discovered radium?”

Using with your own slides
Option A (simple): Replace the demo slides inside QA.html with your slides content.
Option B (separate deck): Keep QA.html as your main file and paste/import your slides into its <section> blocks later.
Either way, re-open or ↻ Rebuild to index new content.

Troubleshooting
• Panel won’t close: click the ✕ in the panel header; if unresponsive, reload the page.
• Dragging the bubble opens the panel: drag farther (or release on empty area) — the button has drag/click protection.
• Old and new answers mixed: the panel clears old results automatically each ask; reload if you customized heavily.
• Nothing is indexed: verify slides exist and load; then press ↻ Rebuild.
• CDN blocked: if offline, swap the Reveal.js assets to local files in the same folder (advanced).

Privacy
Everything runs inside your browser. No questions or slides are sent anywhere.
