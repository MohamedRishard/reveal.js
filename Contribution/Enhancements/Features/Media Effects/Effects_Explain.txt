Explaining Media Effects (CDN Version)

What it is
A slide that applies fun effects like Glitch, VHS scan lines, or a pulsing blur to images/videos.

Why this file is standalone
The file loads Reveal.js and highlight.js directly from a CDN, so it works from any location without relying on local dist/ or plugin/ paths.

How the code works (short breakdown)
• HTML: Buttons with data-fx attributes and media elements marked with class="fx-target".
• CSS: Defines animations for glitch, VHS scanlines, and blur pulse.
• JS:
  - On button click, remove old effect classes and add the chosen one.
  - For Glitch, a data-glitch-text attribute mirrors text for layered pseudo-elements.

One-sentence explanation to say out loud
“This demo uses CSS classes for effects like glitch, VHS, and blurpulse, toggled by buttons, and because it uses CDN links it works from anywhere.”
