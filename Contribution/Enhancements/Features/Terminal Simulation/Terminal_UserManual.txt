Terminal Simulation - User Manual

Overview:
The Terminal Simulation feature allows presenters to demonstrate command line workflows inside a Reveal.js presentation. It looks and feels like a real terminal, but the output is pre-defined and animated, so it is safe and predictable during a live presentation.

How to Use:
1. Opening:
   - Navigate to the slide that contains the terminal simulation.
   - The animation starts automatically when the slide is shown.

2. Replay:
   - Click the ▶ Replay button to restart the terminal simulation.
   - Or press the keyboard shortcut 'R' to replay.

3. Typing Animation:
   - Commands appear character by character, simulating real typing.
   - The caret blinks while typing is in progress.

4. Output:
   - Output lines are color-coded:
     • Green – Commands entered ($ npm run build)
     • Gray – Normal output
     • Yellow – Warnings
     • Red – Errors
     • Blue – File paths or build artifacts
     • Bright Green – Success messages

5. Speed Control:
   - Use the Speed selector (0.5×, 1×, 2×, 3×) to slow down or speed up the animation.

Advantages:
- Makes demonstrations engaging and realistic.
- Ensures consistency by avoiding live terminal errors during presentations.
- Can simulate multiple commands and outputs.
- Fully integrated with Reveal.js using CDN (works standalone).
