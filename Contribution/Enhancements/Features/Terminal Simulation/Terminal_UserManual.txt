Terminal Simulation — User Manual (CDN Version)

Feature
Simulates a terminal (CLI) session inside a slide by auto-typing commands and outputs.

How to Use
1) Open this HTML file in a browser. Reveal.js loads from CDN, so it works from any folder.
2) Navigate to the Terminal slide — the script plays automatically.
3) Leaving and re-entering the slide replays the animation.
4) To customize, edit the script array in the JavaScript.

Advantages
• Demonstrates workflows (e.g., build processes) without using a real terminal.
• Eliminates risk of errors in live demos.
• CDN links ensure no broken paths, portable anywhere.
