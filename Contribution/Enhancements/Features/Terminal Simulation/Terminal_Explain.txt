Explaining Terminal Simulation Feature (Code Explanation)

1. HTML Structure:
   - A terminal container (.terminal) styled to look like a shell.
   - A header with macOS-style dots, a title, speed selector, and Replay button.
   - A body (#termOut) where output lines appear.

2. CSS Styling:
   - Dark background with rounded corners to mimic a real terminal.
   - Lines color-coded by type (command, output, warning, error, file, success).
   - Blinking caret animation for realistic typing.

3. JavaScript Logic:
   - A script array defines the sequence of events (commands + outputs).
     Example:
       { type: 'cmd', text: 'npm run build' }
       { type: 'out', text: 'vite v5 building for production...' }
       { type: 'ok',  text: '✔ Build completed in 2.34s' }

   - play():
     • Clears the terminal.
     • Iterates through the script.
     • For each line, creates an element with appropriate class.
     • Types characters one by one at a configurable speed.
     • Waits briefly between lines and longer after commands.

   - typeLine():
     • Displays text character by character.
     • Shows a blinking caret until the line finishes.

   - Replay:
     • Clicking the Replay button or pressing 'R' aborts the current run and starts over.

   - Speed Control:
     • The speed selector adjusts typing speed by scaling timing values.

   - Reveal Integration:
     • On Reveal.on('ready') and Reveal.on('slidechanged'), the animation auto-plays when the terminal slide becomes visible.

4. Advantages:
   - Simulates realistic terminal interactions without requiring a live environment.
   - Engaging visuals: typing animation, caret, colors, and replay button.
   - Safe for live talks: avoids failed commands or network errors.
   - Works as a standalone file using Reveal.js CDN.

This makes the Terminal Simulation a professional and flexible tool for teaching, training, and technical presentations.
