Explaining Terminal Simulation (CDN Version)

What it is
A slide that mimics a terminal window, auto-typing commands and showing outputs.

Why this file is standalone
This demo loads Reveal.js and its plugins from CDN, so it doesn’t need local dist/ or plugin/ folders.

How the code works (short breakdown)
• HTML: Terminal container with a pre block for output.
• CSS: Monospace font, dark theme, and blinking cursor animation.
• JS:
  - Stores steps in a script array (type 'cmd' or 'out').
  - setInterval() writes one line every 700ms.
  - On 'slidechanged', animation restarts if the terminal slide is shown.

One-sentence explanation to say out loud
“This terminal slide replays a scripted build process with JavaScript typing effect, and it runs from any folder because it uses CDN links.”
