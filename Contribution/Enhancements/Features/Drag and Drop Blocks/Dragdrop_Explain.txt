Explaining Drag-and-Drop Blocks (CDN Version)

What it is
A slide with draggable blocks for simple diagrams or brainstorming.

Why this file is standalone
It uses CDN links for Reveal.js, so no need for local dist/ or plugin/ folders.

How the code works (short breakdown)
• HTML: A container div (canvas-area) with child divs (nodes).
• CSS: Styles nodes with backgrounds, borders, and absolute positioning.
• JS:
  - Listens for pointerdown, pointermove, and pointerup events.
  - Calculates new x,y positions based on pointer location.
  - Constrains movement within the canvas area.

One-sentence explanation to say out loud
“This drag-and-drop slide lets me move blocks to form diagrams, and it works anywhere because it loads Reveal.js from CDN.”
