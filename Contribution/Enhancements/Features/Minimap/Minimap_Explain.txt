Explaining Minimap Feature (Code Explanation)

1. HTML Structure:
   - A toggle button (#minimapToggle) to open/close the minimap panel.
   - A minimap panel (#minimap) containing a grid (#miniGrid) of slide thumbnails.
   - Standard Reveal.js slides (<section>) used as the main presentation content.

2. CSS Styling:
   - Thumbnails are created as small frames (140x80 px) with scaled content.
   - The active slide gets a bright cyan border and glow effect.
   - Both the button and panel are styled as draggable floating elements.

3. JavaScript Logic:
   - Reveal.js is initialized via CDN with progress bar, slide numbers, and hash navigation.
   - buildMinimap():
       • Iterates over all top-level slides.
       • Creates a .thumb element for each slide with scaled-down background and heading/paragraph.
       • Adds a slide number badge in the corner.
       • Attaches a click event to jump to that slide.
   - highlightActive():
       • Tracks the current slide index via Reveal.getIndices().h.
       • Updates thumbnail highlighting whenever slides change.
   - makeDraggable():
       • Makes the toggle button and panel draggable.
       • Stores their positions in localStorage so they persist across reloads.
   - toggleMinimap():
       • Shows/hides the minimap when clicking the button or pressing 'M'.
       • Builds the minimap content dynamically when opened.

4. Advantages:
   - Presenter can see an overview and jump anywhere instantly.
   - Audience can follow structure visually (active slide is always highlighted).
   - Works well with large decks (scrollable panel).
   - Portable: no external dependencies besides Reveal.js CDN.

This makes the Minimap a practical navigation aid in large presentations and a strong demonstration of extending Reveal.js with custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
