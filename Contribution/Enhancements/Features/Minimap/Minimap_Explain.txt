Explaining the Slide Minimap (for Lecturer) — CDN Version

What it is
A simple navigation aid: a floating panel with clickable dots representing each slide.

Why this file is standalone
This demo loads Reveal.js and its plugins from a CDN (cdnjs). That means it works from any folder without needing local `dist/` or `plugin/` paths.

How the code works (short breakdown)
• HTML: A button (#minimapToggle) and a container div (#minimap). The slides are standard <section> elements inside Reveal.js.
• CSS: Positions the panel fixed at the top-left; styles each dot and the active state.
• JS:
  - Reveal.initialize(...) boots Reveal.js (from CDN).
  - buildMinimap(): collects all top-level slides and creates a span.dot for each. Each dot uses Reveal.slide(i) to jump.
  - highlightActive(): checks the current slide index via Reveal.getIndices().h and toggles the 'active' class.
  - Events: Clicking the button shows/hides the panel. The 'slidechanged' event keeps highlight in sync.

One-sentence explanation to say out loud
“This minimap builds clickable dots for each slide and uses Reveal.slide(i) to jump; thanks to CDN links, it runs from any folder.”
