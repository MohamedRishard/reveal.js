Reveal.js Playground - User Manual

Overview:
The Playground feature lets you edit code directly within a presentation slide and see the results instantly in a live preview. 
It is designed to be embedded inside Reveal.js presentations.

How to Use Inside Reveal.js:
1. Add a Playground Slide:
   - Create a new <section> element in your Reveal.js slide deck.
   - Inside it, place a <textarea> with your code (HTML, CSS, or JavaScript).
   - Add an <iframe> that will display the live output.
   - Include a "Run ▶" button to refresh the preview.

2. Example Slide Structure:
   <section>
     <h2>Live Code Playground</h2>
     <div class="playground">
       <div>
         <textarea id="pgCode"><h1>Hello World</h1></textarea>
         <button id="pgRun">Run ▶</button>
       </div>
       <iframe id="pgOutput"></iframe>
     </div>
   </section>

3. JavaScript Initialization:
   - Add a script in your Reveal.js deck to connect the textarea, button, and iframe:
     const code = document.getElementById('pgCode');
     const run = document.getElementById('pgRun');
     const out = document.getElementById('pgOutput');
     function go(){ out.srcdoc = code.value; }
     run.addEventListener('click', go);
     go(); // auto-run on load

4. Run the Presentation:
   - Open your Reveal.js deck in a browser.
   - Navigate to the slide with the Playground.
   - Edit the code on the left, click "Run ▶", and see changes instantly in the iframe.

Tips:
- Use multiple Playground slides to show different demos throughout your presentation.
- Combine with Reveal.js fragments to progressively enhance the demo step-by-step.
- Keep the code small and focused for clarity during live presentations.

Best Use Cases:
- Teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics.
- Demonstrating live web effects (animations, interactivity).
- Allowing interactive experiments during talks or lessons.
