Explaining Live Code Playground (CDN Version)

What it is
A mini code editor + preview inside a slide. Useful for showing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript live.

Why this file is standalone
It loads Reveal.js from CDN, so no need to worry about project folder structure.

How the code works (short breakdown)
• HTML: A <textarea> holds code, a button triggers execution, and an <iframe> shows output.
• CSS: Splits layout into two columns (editor and preview).
• JS:
  - Reads the textarea content.
  - Sets the iframe's srcdoc property with that code.
  - Run ▶ button reloads preview with new edits.

One-sentence explanation to say out loud
“This playground slide lets me edit code in a textarea and instantly preview it in an iframe, and it works from any folder thanks to CDN links.”
