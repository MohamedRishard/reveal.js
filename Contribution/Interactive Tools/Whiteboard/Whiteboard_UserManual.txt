Whiteboard Overlay - User Manual

Overview:
The Whiteboard feature is a drawing tool integrated into Reveal.js presentations. It allows presenters to annotate slides in real-time using a draggable toolbar and a toggle button.

How to Use:
1. Toggle Whiteboard:
   - Click the ✏️ Whiteboard button (top-right corner) to open/close the whiteboard.
   - Press 'W' on your keyboard to toggle visibility.
   - Press 'ESC' to close quickly.

2. Toolbar Controls:
   - Color Picker: Change brush color.
   - Size Slider: Adjust brush thickness; the number beside shows current size in pixels.
   - Clear Button: Erase everything on the canvas instantly.

3. Drawing:
   - Hold the mouse button (or touch/pen) and move to draw.
   - Brush color and size are applied live as you draw.

4. Moving UI:
   - The Whiteboard button and the toolbar can be dragged anywhere on the screen.
   - Drag them out of the way to avoid blocking slide content.

Advantages:
- Easy annotation directly on slides during presentations.
