                                                  **Interactive Q&A Poll** (Demo Version)

This slide is created to demonstrate an interactive question and answer session at the end of a presentation.

The main purpose is to give the audience a simple way to respond to the question “Do you have any questions?”.

On the left side of the slide a QR code is displayed, which the audience can scan, and on the right side a chart shows the responses with two options, Yes and No.



In this demo version, the QR code and chart are fully designed and displayed inside the presentation.

The **chart values are not collected from real participants yet**; instead,

the **numbers change automatically to simulate how it will look in a real session.** 

This gives a clear idea of how the poll will appear on the screen when it is used in practice.



The **backend process**, which will connect the QR code with actual voting and update the chart based on live audience responses, **is already under progress**.

Since that part is not included here, this version is mainly for showing the front-end view and user experience of the poll system.



**Once the backend is completed and connected, the system will be able to collect votes directly from the audience and display the results in real time during the presentation.**
